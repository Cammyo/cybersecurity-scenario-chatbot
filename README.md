# cybersecurity-scenario-chatbot
This was the final for a class I took on Generative AI. Also got a couple Nvidia certs from that class too!

## Introduction
A cybersecurity scenario generation chatbot for attackers/defenders to hack/protect a generated organization.


## Technologies
- ElectronJS cross-platform desktop app.
- Small SPA so only needed vanilla HTML/CSS.
- Dify.ai for easy chatbot implementation.
- SQLite to fulfill a database requirement for the assignment.

## Installation/Building
All you need is node. Configured for windows x64 but could be built any platform.

```
npm install
npm start
npm run build
```
